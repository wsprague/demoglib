Citab calculates confidence intervals for a variable in ACS PUMS data.

Read citab.R to see the function definition.  Look at citab-test.R to see it in
action as it is used on sample data.  Run `make test` from the command line
(need the "make" program, which is standard in a Unix environment) to run
citab-test.R and see if everything works as expected.
