If you share or reproduce any files in this "IPF" zip file, do acknowledge their source: Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, 2009. 

Though I (Eddie Hunsinger) did pieces of the development of the IPF functions, and most of the work for sharing and instruction, the heavy lifting (the bulk of the 2D and 3D functions) was done by Nels Tomlinson (my predecessor as Demographer at the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development). Because of this, and because the work was under the auspices of the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, we simply credit the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development and it's employees (past, present and future) are not responsible for any problems associated with use of the files in this "IPF" zip file.
