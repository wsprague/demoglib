How to use the AKDOLWD IPF code for R:Note: Throughout the "HowTo", "Functions" and "Scripts", you will need to change "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF..." to match the location of the "IPF" directory on your own computer.2DIPF1. Install R (http://www.r-project.org/) (probably best to install somewhere other than your programs directory.2. Format the tabulated data to match the three input files found in the "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/HowTo/PracticeData/2DExample" directory, and save them as comma separated (.csv) files. "Col.csv" is the column margin, "Row.csv" is the row margin, and "Seed.csv" is the initial (unadjusted) table. "Output.csv" will be the final (adjusted) table. You can find many more examples in "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/Completed".3. Open 2DDataMassage.txt file from the "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/ Scripts" directory, update the directory paths in the script to the respective input and output data files on your computer (they're currently set to the practice data examples), and copy and paste the script into R. Note the command "source("R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/Functions/ipf2df.txt")", that is the function that was written to do IPF-feel free to open and review it, that'll probably help to understand more about what's going on.4. There may be "Warning messages" printed in the R window when the script is run-these are probably just to state that input zeroes were changed to .001. 3DIPF1. Install R (http://www.r-project.org/) (probably best to install somewhere other than your programs directory.2. Format the tabulated data to match the four input files found in the "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/HowTo/PracticeData/3DExample" directory, and save them as comma separated (.csv) files. "Col.csv" is the column margin, "Row.csv" is the row margin, "Stack.csv" is the stack margin, and "Seed.csv" is the initial (unadjusted) table. "Output.csv" will be the final (adjusted) table. You can find many more examples in "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/Completed".3. Open 3DDataMassage.txt file from the "R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/ Scripts" directory, update the directory paths in the script to the respective input and output data files on your computer, update line 9 to reflect the side sizes of the table being adjusted, and copy and paste the script into R. Note the commands "source("R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/Functions/ipf2df.txt")" and "source("R:/RA/RAPOP/EDDIE/IPF/Functions/ipf3df.txt")", those are the functions that were written to do IPF-feel free to open and review them.4. There may be "Warning messages" printed in the R window when the script is run-these are probably just to state that input zeroes were changed to .001.4DIPF1.
